# Certificate level II: Build a robot


    The robot should create a ZIP archive of the PDF receipts (one zip archive that contains all the PDF files). Store the archive in the output directory.
    The robot should complete all the orders even when there are technical failures with the robot order website.
    The robot should read some data from a local vault. In this case, do not store sensitive data such as credentials in the vault. The purpose is to verify that you know how to use the vault.
    The robot should use an assistant to ask some input from the human user, and then use that input some way.
    The robot should be available in public GitHub repository.
    Store the local vault file in the robot project repository so that it does not require manual setup.
    It should be possible to get the robot from the public GitHub repository and run it without manual setup.
